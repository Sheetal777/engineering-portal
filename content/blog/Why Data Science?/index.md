description: "Data Science is basically a field that uses scientific data and applies statistical processes on it to give a structured piece of useful information. But why should YOU/ME go for it? Does it pay REALLY well? Is it analogous to Machine Learning or Deep Learning? So, these are some 'most asked' questions about Data Science. It is high time that we get a clear knowledge about this field as it doesn't only pay good, but also demands a good deal of skills to get there. Because we are getting stuffed around particular fields and don't know about the others. Let us re-collect the scattered pieces of information we actually have about Data Science. And let's figure out what has made it such a fascinating field to get into."

# What is Data Science?

Data Science has become popular in these recent times, isn't it?

Every other engineering student is searching about What Data Science is, Data Scientist salaries, benefits, courses and what not. 

But neither the pay scale, or the reputation makes it the amazing thing it actually is. Those are mere consequences of its authenticity. 

Let us discuss about the "Why" of Data Science. 

If we stand on terms of definition,
Data science is a field which uses scientific processes,  methods, algorithms & systems. These systems extract insights and knowledge from various structural & unstructured data. In addition, Data science connects to machine learning, data mining, and big data.

Data science is a "Concept to analyze data, unify statistics, and related procedures". It is done in to "understand & analyze real phenomena" with data. It also uses theories and techniques withdrawn from various fields. These fields are within the context of statistics, mathematics, computer science, information science, and domain knowledge.
